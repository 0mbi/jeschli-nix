* Some of my nix files.

** What it is?

This repository contains of my nix files
that I normally use on all my NixOS desktop computers.

Currently it contains my:
- i3 configuration
- emacs configuration.

** i3 configuration

It is mostly the generated i3 configuration file.
Additional it contains firefox and my-emacs-server
on startup.

** emacs configuration

It is quite lengthy as it is based on modified
emacs org-mode configuration by Bernt Hansen as
explained in: [[http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html][Org Mode - Organize Your Life In Plain Text!]]

** Note

It is independent from any krebso stockholm mechanism
and can be used on a vanilla NixOS.
